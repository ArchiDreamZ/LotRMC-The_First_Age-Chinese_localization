Stately limbs and slender twigs,
Leaves on graceful tender sprigs,
Flowers like a silver star,
Vardarianna of the Valar.
Stars in night sky glimmering,
Stars below them shimmering.
Pleasant fragrance wandring round,
Lingering over leafy ground,
Falling from the starry blooms,
In the forest’s vaulted rooms.
