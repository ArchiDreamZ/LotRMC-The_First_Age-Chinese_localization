Tall grows the fair tree Malinornë,
That blooms round the haven of Avallónë.
Silver pillars raise shimmering eaves,
Silken bark and pale green leaves.

Gold are the leaves when Summer fades,
Gold through the winter’s chilling days.
Down the cold spring winds golden leaf drifts,
Scent of the clustered golden blooms wifts.
