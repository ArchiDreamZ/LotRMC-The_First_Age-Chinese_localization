Long grow the days on these forlorn lands;
Glory is fading from days of yore.
Soon I will seek for the silver sands,
Havens and waters where white gulls soar.

I long to feel the gentle breeze,
And unfurl sails to catch the wind.
Soon I will journey the rolling seas,
Leaving the place of my youth behind.

Then I will reach the Undying Lands,
At last alighting on shining shore.
To the green hills where Tirion stands,
There resting pleasantly far from war.
