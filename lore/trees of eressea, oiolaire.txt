欧幽莱瑞绿而宽，海边枝蔓总流连。
海风吹拂树梢摇，阳光照耀绿叶展。
咸水浸泡更精神，沙地覆盖愈灿烂。
不畏水火金木土，要留翠绿在人间。
Oiolairë grows green and wide,
Spreading branches along the seaside.
Glossy leaves in sea-breeze sway,
Flourishing in sea-foam spray.
Branches sundered thriving yet,
As long as kept by sea-foam wet.
Lush green carpet over land,
Growing in the salty sand.
