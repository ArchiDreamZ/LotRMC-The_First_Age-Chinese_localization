#A note an ancient smith made to remind himself the art of making the lamps should he forget.

We heading eastward has drained us of our former power. All our time and focus is spent on war. 
I fear I will forget how to create these fair lights eventually, having to focus on swords and armor nearly every day. 
Perhaps I can teach our children the craft after we have won the war.

The spheres are made of a combination of glass and crystal: the glass to refract light and the crystal to reinforce it. 
They are hollow, and at the base of the sphere a pedestal should stand. This of course is the easy part, the rest comes to our spiritual strength. 
We are not Fëanor, that is a certain, but we can create a light if we focus hard enough. I believe that is what Fëanor intended. 
The pedestal should have a clear crystal so the fire we kindle will shine brightly. 
We can dim the light without needing to extinguish it like a flame, neither must we open these spheres to replace the crystal. 
I do not know if we will be able to achieve such a thing when we have won the war...Perhaps they can be gifts to royalty. 
They have a stronger spirit than many of us do.
