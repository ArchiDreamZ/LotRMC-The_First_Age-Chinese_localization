My duty is to my captain # and the lands over which I stand guard.
The servants of Morgoth that shall perish before us!
I have sworn to defend the lands of the Haladin, and defend them I shall!
I will follow you wherever you go!
Let's hunt some Orc!
Orcs do not happily tread in these woods, so fierce are we.
Foul beasts fear the blades of the Brethil.
Let our axes hew the heads of many an Orc!
My captain, #, shall lead us to many victories.
Is your blade sharp, #? Let the servants of Morgoth be reminded of why they fear these woods.
My axe is your axe, my blade is your blade.
I am yours to command, #.
I have sworn an oath. I will not betray it, should Morgoth himself stand before us.
Your service is song, captain #.
No orc shall enter these woods, while I fight under your command.
