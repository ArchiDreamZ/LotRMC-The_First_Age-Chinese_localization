What brings you to this wilderness, #?
These lands are my domain, #, and I do all in my power to safeguard them.
It is good to see a friend of the Haladin!
I see you are a friend of Brethil, #.
Let your axe be sharp and your breastplate stout, #.
We keep to our own. We do not want part in the quarrels of the Noldor.
Morgoth sends his orcs from Tor-in-Gaurhoth. They do not return.
Sharpen your blades and strengthen your shield, #.
Morgoth's power grows. Orcs march ever closer.
I have heard of your deeds, #. It is an honour to meet you.
Will you join us in the hunt, #?
Let's hunt some Orc!
The blood of orcs will stain the ground.
Doubt not the strength of the Haladin, #. We have heroes with us yet.
