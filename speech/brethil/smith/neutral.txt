Are you friend or foe?
You must earn more respect among my people if you want to trade with me.
Your valour is unproven, #.
I only trade with trusted friends, #.
The Woodmen of Brethil do not know you yet, #. Come back when you have more deeds to your name.
First prove your allegiance to the Haladin, then ask to trade with me.
My blades are of high reknown. Return when you are too.
Prove your worth to Brethil, and I will trade with you.
I am not at ease with you, #.
You are yet to prove yourself to us, #. I do not trust you yet.
I can smith you fine armour, #, but you must first prove yourself worthy of it.
Earn my trust before asking for my wares.
How can I trust you, #?
You are not known to me, #.
Are you a friend of Brethil, or its enemy?
Are you a friend of the Haladin, #?
