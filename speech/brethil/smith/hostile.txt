Don't expect armour from me.
Begone, #! Go back to the shadow from whence you came!
You are an enemy of Brethil!
You are an enemy of the Edain!
I refuse to trade with scoundrels like you, #.
I will give you nothing, #.
This hammer is good for more than forging steel.
How dare you enter these lands!
Leave this place, #, before more Woodmen come.
Now that you have defiled these woods, you will not leave alive.
The Haladin want no business with you, #!
Our soldiers are hunting you down as we speak.
Spawn of Morgoth! We do not want you here!
Our blades are sharp, and do not show mercy on the likes of you.
Return to your master Morgoth!
