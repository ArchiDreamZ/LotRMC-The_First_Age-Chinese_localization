You must earn more respect among my people if you want to trade with me.
Prove that you can be trusted, and I will offer you my wares.
I am uneasy about you, #.
Are you a friend of Brethil, or its enemy?
Are you a friend of the Haladin, #?
I only trade with trusted friends, #.
I do not trade with any odd stranger that passes by...
You will have to prove your allegiance to the Haladin if you wish to trade with me.
I do not trust you enough to trade with you. You will have to prove yourself, #.
You will have to do more good before I can trade with you.
Are you friend or foe?
Your valour is unproven, #.
I only trade with trusted friends, #.
The Woodmen of Brethil do not know you yet, #. Come back when you have more deeds to your name.
I do not offer my wares to anyone, #.
