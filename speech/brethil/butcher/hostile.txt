Don't expect food from me.
You are an enemy of Brethil!
You are an enemy of the Edain!
I refuse to trade with scoundrels like you, #.
I will give you nothing, #.
How dare you enter these lands!
Leave this place, #, before more Woodmen come.
Now that you have defiled these woods, you will not leave alive.
The Haladin want no business with you, #!
Our soldiers are hunting you down as we speak.
Spawn of Morgoth! We do not want you here!
My wares are too good for the likes of you!
I do not supply servants of the Enemy.
These knives can cut more than just carcasses!
