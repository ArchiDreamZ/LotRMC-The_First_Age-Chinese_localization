It is good to see you again, #.
The Haladin have guarded these lands for nigh on 100 years.
The Haladin welcome you to Brethil, friend.
From the Crossings of Teiglin to the Sirion, the Haldin roam.
We keep to our own. We do not want part in the quarrels of the Noldor.
The arm of Morgoth grows longer, but Brethil will remain a haven against it.
Minas Tirith has fallen, Dorthonion is overun. Yet of all the orcs that marched through Brethil, not one escaped.
Rest a little while under the silver-birch, friend.
Morgoth sends his orcs from Tor-in-Gaurhoth. They do not return.
Let your axe be sharp and your breastplate stout, #.
The struggles of the First House are not our struggles.
We may not issue forth hosts, but do not underestimate our valour.
What brings you to Brethil, #?
What business have you in these lands, friend?
Sharpen your blades and strengthen your shield, #.
It is good to see a friend of the Haladin!
I see you are a friend of Brethil, #.
These forests are old and strong.
Though we may be solitary, we do not lack for company.
The Lady Haleth led us here. We shall not move again.
This wood stretches south to the Teiglin and north to the Sirion.
Do not bring me news of the outside world, #. I do not wish to hear it.
Morgoth's power grows. Orcs march ever closer.
If the Girdle of Melian will hold, so too shall Brethil.
This is a safe haven for scattered peoples.
Women and children of the First House flee here. Are we to deny them safety?
Nargothrond should face all the power of Morgoth, were we not standing in his way.
Doubt not the strength of the Haladin, #. We have heroes with us yet.
The sun is not setting on the Haladin, #.
I have heard of your deeds, #. It is an honour to meet you.
