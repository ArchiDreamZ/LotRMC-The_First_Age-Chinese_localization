You are an enemy of Brethil!
You are an enemy of the Edain!
How dare you enter these lands!
Leave this place, #, before more Woodmen come.
Now that you have defiled these woods, you will not leave alive.
The Haladin want no business with you, #!
Our soldiers are hunting you down as we speak.
Spawn of Morgoth! We do not want you here!
Our blades are sharp, and do not show mercy on the likes of you.
Return to your master Morgoth!
If the Enemy sent you, he will not hear back.
These woods are not a place for you.
Go back to your orc-friends, #.
We know who you are, #. Leave here and never come back.
Leave and never return to Brethil.
You are no friend of the Haladin.
We do not desire your presence, #.
You ought to be killed for your crimes, #.
Do not come any closer, #.
What do you think you are doing here, #.
The likes of you don't belong here.
Begone, Orc-scum!
What madness led you here?
Crawl back into the night, #!
These lands are guarded closely, #. You will find no refuge here!
There is no refuge here for the likes of you!
Villains like you are unwelcome here!
I shall make an end of you!
You are not welcome in these lands, #!
What are you, #? Some Orc-spy?
Do not underestimate the power of Brethil.
Begone, #!
You will leave these lands now!
You cannot pass!
What devilry do you bring here?
Morgoth has no power here! Begone!
Get yourself gone from these lands.
You ruffian!
Your villainry is not wanted here!
Our armies are numerous and our swords keen. You will not escape!
