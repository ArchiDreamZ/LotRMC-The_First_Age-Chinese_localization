Where's the nearest Elf-flesh? I'm starving here!
What are your orders, my lord?
You may be my chieftain, #, but you're still a filthy maggot!
I smell new flesh!
Lead us to war, #!
The air is ripe with the stink of fear!
I've had nothing to eat but maggoty bread for three stinking days!
The free peoples of the earth shall fall before our might!
Death! Death to all who oppose us!
Shall we hunt some Elf-flesh, #?
My stomach is dying for Elf-flesh!
I am ready to hunt some Elf-scum.
Death to those filthy Elves, and all their allies!
Let us wreak havoc upon the world of Elves!
