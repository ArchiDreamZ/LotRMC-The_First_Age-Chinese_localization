What do silver coins and Elf-flesh have in common? I never have enough of them!
You want some mercenaries, #? I want some coins.
Get your fighting Orcs here! Starting at just a few silver coins!
I want to get my stinking hands on some more silver coins!
The tribes of Dor-na-Daerachas are ready to slaughter, maggot!
The Northern Waste has many fine stinking Orcs for you to command!
The filth of the North doesn't come cheap, #!
You want to hire some maggots from Dor-na-Daerachas? Just bring me some stinking coins!
You want my boys, you can have them! For a dozen silver coins of course. Ha! Ha!

Orcs aren't free. You'll need to give me some coins, or no deal!
Come and get your warrior Orcs here!
