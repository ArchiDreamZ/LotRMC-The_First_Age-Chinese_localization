I'm afraid that I cannot trust you enough, #.
Prove me to me that you are a friend of my people and I'll serve you a drink.
If you are a friend of the Elves, you are no friend of mine.
Come again once you have demonstrated your loyalty to the House of Ulfang.
I do not serve drinks to strangers.
You are no friend of our people, #.
Are you a servant of the Elves?
I pray for both of us that you are not an enemy of my people.
