Welcome, my friend! What would you like today?
I forge the finest arms all across the land!
Men come from leagues around to buy my wares!
Good day to you, #! I have many items in stock that may interest you!
I happened to be forging all morning in case someone showed up, let me show you!
My blades are sharp, my daggers keen, and my armor polished!
My wares are greater than anything that the fiendish Elves could make!
I presume you are here to trade with me, #?
If you have a few silver coins, you could get a great bargain, #.
You seem like the type who would know a good deal when you see one, I respect that.
I am always open for another trade, what are you looking for?
Competition is a drive for better bargains, #.
I saw you look, yes, my wares are THAT good!
You have an eye for detail, am I right? Take a closer look at the quality of my wares, #.
