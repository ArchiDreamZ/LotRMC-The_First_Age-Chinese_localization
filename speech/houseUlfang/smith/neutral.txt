I will not forge arms for a stranger, #.
I trade only with the kin of Ulfang.
You shall have to go elsewhere for your weapons.
What are you even doing here, my friend?
You are not one of our people, my friend.
I'm afraid I do not trust you enough to sell to you.
You are a stranger to our lands, #.
I would welcome you, #, but my heart grows uneasy around a stranger.
What insurance do I have that you won't use my items against me?
Be on your way, I have nothing I am willing to part to you.
If you can you prove your loyalty, I shall consider selling my wares to you.
I care for competition, but I'm not that desperate yet.
