Please, no more...
I swear, those missing crops were the birds' work!
I am grateful...
I could not be happier...
This is a good life...
I don't know where you come from, but you seem different from everyone else.
By the law, I am not meant to talk with you, #.
Perhaps you can free me? No? So be it.
I'll sleep outside, that's fine.
The master will whip me if I say any more.
Sorry, I can't talk to you.
Please, just leave. You will only get me in trouble.
Why are you bothering a slave like me?
Just go and enjoy your freedom.
Please, #. I cannot talk to you.
Oh dear, oh dear...
I miss my home...
I wonder if my family are still alive...
At least I'm alive...
Today, I saw a bird. I had to chase it away.
I miss the days where rabbits were my friends. Now all they do is cause my master to whip me when they come too near.
One, two, three...
Four, five, six...
Too many scars to count.
How long have I been here?
When was the last time I ate a good meal?
Hello, little flower. Sorry, but you have to go.
Carrots, potatoes, wheat. Carrots, potatoes, wheat.
Oh no, I hope the rain doesn't make me ill again.
Ah, so be it.
