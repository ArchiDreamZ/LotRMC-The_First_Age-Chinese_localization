You seem like a warrior of my kind, #.
The rich lands of Beleriand will be ours!
I have crushed many heads in battle. Have you, #?
What do you need?
Our master has promised us glory!
We have come from the far east by our master's command.
Welcome to our lands, #!
Warriors of great might, such as yourself, are welcome in these lands.
The elven filth are no match for the strength of the Kin of Ulfang!
Are you one of us, #?
Will you fight alongside us on the battlefield, #?
The blood of the Elves will be shed soon enough.
We shall bring glory to our people!
The clan of BÃ³r calls us traitors when they are the ones who turned their back on the Dark Lord.
Death to the servants of the Valar!
The age of the Elves is over!
The land of Lothlann is rightfully ours. Pay no heed to the words of Elves.
If you are an enemy of the Elves, you are a friend of ours.
Any ally of Morgoth is welcome in our lands.
