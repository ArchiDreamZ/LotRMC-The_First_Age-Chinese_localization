Let us burn their homes to ash!
We fight for you, #!
I can almost taste the Elves' wretched blood, #.
Lead us to battle!
You are a mighty warrior of our clan, #!
I want to crush their skulls under my foot!
Where is the fight, #? I want to kill!
The roar of battle awaits!
Your enemies are our enemies, #!
Let us stain the ground with the blood of traitors!
My weapon hungers for a head to split!
Scars await us in the battle ahead, #.
You are a great warrior, #. Lead us to victory.
