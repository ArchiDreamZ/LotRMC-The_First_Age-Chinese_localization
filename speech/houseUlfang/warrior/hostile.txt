I'll smash your face in!
Die, Elven filth!
You are not one of us. Flee, scum!
You allied with the Elves. Now only punishment awaits you!
Run while you still can!
You are an enemy of the Dark Lord. Death awaits you!
You will bleed quickly and die fast, #!
I'll break your legs, and then you won't be running any more!
Your screams won't be heard by your filthy kin here!
Death to you and your kin!
I'll skin you like a rabbit!
You belong with the meat, roasting on my fire!
You dare betray your kind for the sake of the Elves?
You are no friend of ours, #!
Your doom is imminent, #!
Scream for your life, weakling!
You will squeal like the rest of the Elven rats!
Curse you, friend of the Elves!
I will flay you alive!
I have gutted tougher fish than you, #!
