You are a friend of the Elves, have you no shame?
Begone, Elven filth!
You are not one of us. Stay away from my people!
You allied with the Elves. Now only punishment awaits you!
Run while you still can!
You are an enemy of our master. Death awaits you!
I shall ensure no other man shall fear your name, #!
I'll break your legs, and then you won't be running any more!
Your screams won't be heard by your filthy kin here!
Death to you and your kin!
You dare betray your kind for the sake of the Elves?
You are no friend of ours, #!
Your doom is imminent, #!
Curse you, friend of the Elves!
