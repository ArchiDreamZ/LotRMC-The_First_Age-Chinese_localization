I shall help you bring freedom to our clan!
We fight for you, #!
Let us take revenge for the sins that the Elves have commited against our people, #!
Lead us to battle!
You are a mighty warrior of our clan, #!
Serving under your command brings me great honour!
Where is the fight, #? We shall have our vengeance!
The lands of Beleriand will be ours!
Your enemies are our enemies, #!
Let us stain the ground with the blood of traitors!
My weapon hungers to put an end to the fiendish Elves!
Scars await us in the battle ahead, #.
You are a great warrior, #. Lead us to victory.
