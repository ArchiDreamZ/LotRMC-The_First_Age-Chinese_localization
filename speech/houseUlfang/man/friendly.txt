Our people have migrated from the lands of Rhûn in hopes of prosperity.
The Elvish fiends have no right to the fertile lands of Beleriand.
I fear the wrath of the evil Elves. Have you heard the rumors of their cruelty, #?
What do you need?
Our master has promised to reward us for our loyalty.
We have come from the far east by our master's command.
Welcome to our lands, #!
Warriors of great might, such as yourself, are welcome in these lands.
I heard one of our villages was raided by the clan of Bór. I do not understand why they betrayed our master.
Are you one of us, #?
Will you save us from the vile Elves, #?
Until the last of the Elves perish, I fear for the safety of my family.
Fear not, #! Our master has promised to protect us in our time of need!
The clan of Bór calls us traitors when they are the ones who turned their back on the Dark Lord.
The cruelty of the Elves knows no bounds!
The age of the Elves is nearing its end!
The land of Lothlann is rightfully ours. Pay no heed to the words of Elves.
If you are an enemy of the Elves, you are a friend of ours.
Any ally of the great lord is welcome in our lands.
