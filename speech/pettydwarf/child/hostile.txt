I don't like you. Go away!
You're a bad person, #.
Raaaarrrrggghhh!
If I had an axe, I'd split your skull in two!
My kin may have been exiled, but we'll fight!
You had better run before my father comes back with his axe!
Leave or face the wrath of my kin!
You should leave our lands! We Dwarves do not welcome evil-doers such as you!
