My duty is to my captain # and the lands over which I stand guard.
The servants of Morgoth that shall perish before us!
I have sworn to defend Doriath, and defend it I shall!
I will follow you wherever you go!
Let's hunt some Orc!
My captain, #, shall lead us to many victories.
I am yours to command, #.
I have sworn an oath. I will not betray it, should Morgoth himself stand before us.
Your service is song, captain #.
No orc shall enter these woods, while I fight under your command.
My bow is your bow, my blade is your blade.
I shall stand by your side, #, in the face of death if you ask it.
