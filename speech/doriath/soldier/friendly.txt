What brings you to these forests, #?
These lands are my domain, #, and I do all in my power to safeguard them.
I see you are a friend of Doriath, #.
I am sworn to protect these forests.
Sharpen your blades and strengthen your shield, #.
Morgoth's power grows. Orcs march ever closer.
I have heard of your deeds, #. It is an honour to meet you.
Will you join us in the hunt, #?
While the Girdle holds, there is little to do but prepare for the war which must one day come.
Let's hunt some Orc!
Keep yourself safe, #.
It is good to see a friend of the Sindar.
Morgoth's arm grows ever longer, but it is yet to reach here.
It is good to see you again, friend.
