What can I do for you, #?
It is good to see a friend of the Sindar.
I'm still looking for an apprentice.
The Girdle keeps us safe, #. It is dangerous to go beyond it.
We want no part in the affairs of the Noldor.
Have you gazed upon the halls of Thingol? Get ye to Menegroth, and wonder.
Foul things move abroad. Let us trust in the Girdle of Melian to keep Morgoth back.
Fine timbers and lumber are my wares. What do you want?
These are the finest lumbers between here and Menegroth.
I have woods from all the lands within the Girdle.
I am happy to see you again, #.
A few silver coins, and these timbers can be yours.
Are you in need of my wares, #?
These stout timbers will last many years.
My axes grow blunt. I need new heads.
