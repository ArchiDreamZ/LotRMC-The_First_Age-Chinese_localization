What can I do for you, #?
It is good to see a friend of the Sindar.
I have the finest loaves in all Doriath.
A small price to pay for sustenance.
The price of wheat grows high, and my margins slim.
I'm still looking for an apprentice.
Here, take these. A small sum and you will have food enough to last your journeys.
Are you looking for food, #?
If you're hungry, #, you've come to the right place.
The Girdle keeps us safe, #. It is dangerous to go beyond it.
We want no part in the affairs of the Noldor.
Have you gazed upon the halls of Thingol? Get ye to Menegroth, and wonder.
Foul things move abroad. Let us trust in the Girdle of Melian to keep Morgoth back.
These loaves will sustain you for days on end.
Are you in need of bread, #?
