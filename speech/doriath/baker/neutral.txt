The Sindar do not know you, #.
Are you friend or foe?
How did one unknown to us pass through the Girdle of Melian?
We do not want a part in the affairs of the Noldor.
Do you bring evil into Doriath, #?
I do not sell my loaves to any passer-by.
Prove yourself, then we'll talk.
My wares are not for strangers.
Add some deeds to your name before asking again.
What brings you to Doriath, #?
Why would you expect me to trust someone like you?
Who are you, #?
What is your business in these lands?
I do not trust you yet, #.
You are yet to prove your worth, #.
