Get ye gone from this place!
Return to your master Morgoth!
We do not want your kind here, #!
Already our soldiers hunt your trail, #!
What are you doing this side of the Girdle?
Our blades will cut you down.
Do you fear death, #?
Begone, #, and do not return.
We do not want your sort here.
There is no place for foul things like you in this forest.
You foul the earth on which you tread. Let us see that you do no more.
I can hunt down more than just elk.
You will not leave here alive, #.
We did warn you this would happen.
Your master Morgoth will not hear back from you!
