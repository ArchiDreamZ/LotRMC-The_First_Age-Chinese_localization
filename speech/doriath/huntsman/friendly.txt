What can I do for you, #?
It is good to see a friend of the Sindar.
I'm still looking for an apprentice.
Here, take these. A small sum and you will have food enough to last your journeys.
Are you looking for food, #?
If you're hungry, #, you've come to the right place.
The Girdle keeps us safe, #. It is dangerous to go beyond it.
We want no part in the affairs of the Noldor.
Have you gazed upon the halls of Thingol? Get ye to Menegroth, and wonder.
Foul things move abroad. Let us trust in the Girdle of Melian to keep Morgoth back.
I have here skins, pelts and meats of all kinds. What do you desire?
The woods are always rich with game. I bring only the finest cuts.
A few silver coins will bring the finest meats this side of Doriath.
Just a small sum will buy my wares.
Keep yourself inside the Girdle, #.
