The Sindar do not know you, #.
Are you friend or foe?
How did one unknown to us pass through the Girdle of Melian?
We do not want a part in the affairs of the Noldor.
Do you bring evil into Doriath, #?
What brings you to Doriath, #?
Why would you expect me to trust someone like you?
Who are you, #?
What is your business in these lands?
I do not trust you yet, #.
You are yet to prove your worth, #.
Add some deeds to your name, #.
You have not earned our trust.
I am uneasy about you, #.
I trust you are a friend?
We do not know you well, #.
These forests are old and strong.
From where do you hail, #?
The Girdle keeps us safe, #. It is dangerous to go beyond it.
We want no part in the affairs of the Noldor.
Have you gazed upon the halls of Thingol? Get ye to Menegroth, and wonder.
Foul things move abroad. Let us trust in the Girdle of Melian to keep Morgoth back.
Orcs would overrun all Beleriand before the Girdle of Melian should fall.
We roam all the way from the banks of Aros to the River Mindeb.
There is food enough in the Forest for all who hunger.
The arm of Morgoth grows longer, but Doriath will remain a haven against it.
Do not bring news of the outside world. We do not want to hear it.
We are wary of strangers, #. Add some deeds to your name and you shall earn our trust.
You are yet unknown to us, #.
