Get ye gone from this place!
Return to your master Morgoth!
We do not want your kind here, #!
Already our soldiers hunt your trail, #!
What are you doing this side of the Girdle?
Our blades will cut you down.
Do you fear death, #?
Begone, #, and do not return.
We do not want your sort here.
There is no place for foul things like you in this forest.
You foul the earth on which you tread. Let us see that you do no more.
Feel the bite of our blades!
Tell me, how does it feel to die in Doriath?
Your master Morgoth will not hear back from you!
If Morgoth wishes to send more spies, he will not succeed.
How is one like you inside the Girdle?
Begone, #.
Prepare to die, #.
Spawn of Morgoth! We do not want you here!
Our blades are sharp, and do not show mercy on the likes of you.
These woods are not a place for you.
Go back to your orc-friends, #.
We know who you are, #. Leave here and never come back.
Leave and never return to Doriath.
You are no friend of the Sindar.
You ought to be killed for your crimes, #.
Do not come any closer, #.
What do you think you are doing here, #.
The likes of you don't belong here.
Begone, Orc-scum!
What madness led you here?
Crawl back into the night, #!
These lands are guarded closely, #. You will find no refuge here!
There is no refuge here for the likes of you!
Villains like you are unwelcome here!
I shall make an end of you!
You are not welcome in these lands, #!
What are you, #? Some Orc-spy?
What devilry do you bring to Doriath?
You villain!
You fool! Our soldiers move closer as we speak.
