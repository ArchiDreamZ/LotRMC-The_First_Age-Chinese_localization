The Girdle keeps us safe, #. It is dangerous to go beyond it.
We want no part in the affairs of the Noldor.
Have you gazed upon the halls of Thingol? Get ye to Menegroth, and wonder.
Foul things move abroad. Let us trust in the Girdle of Melian to keep Morgoth back.
It is good to see a friend of the Sindar.
Do not bring news of the outside world. We do not want to hear it.
Keep yourself inside the Girdle, #. It is safer to do so.
No beast or being can walk through the Girdle without Thingol's knowledge.
The wars of the Noldor are not ours to fight in.
The armies of Morgoth gather, but they shall not pass through the Girdle.
Dorthonion is overrun, Minas Tirith is no more. We are fortunate to have the Girdle of Melian.
The arm of Morgoth grows longer, but Doriath will remain a haven against it.
The Sindar welcome you to Doriath, friend.
What business brings you here, #?
I see you are a friend of the Sindar, #.
We may not issue forth hosts, but do not underestimate our valour.
These forests are old and strong.
May your blade be strong and your breastplate stout.
Orcs would overrun all Beleriand before the Girdle of Melian should fall.
We roam all the way from the banks of Aros to the River Mindeb.
All of Neldoreth and Region is inside the Girdle. Is that not enough land for one elf to roam?
Rest a little while under the beeches of Neldoreth, friend.
Rest a little while under the holly of Region, friend.
Is it not beautiful under the trees, #?
I do not envy those in other lands. Who would?
There is food enough in the Forest for all who hunger.
How are you today, #?
Doubt not the strength of the Sindar, #.
We are happy here, #.
