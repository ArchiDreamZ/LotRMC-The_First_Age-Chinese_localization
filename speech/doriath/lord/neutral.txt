Only the strongest friends of the Sindar may fight with us in battle, #.
If you wish to captain the Sindar, you must prove your worth.
Are you friend or foe, #?
Who are you to lead us in battle, #?
Go and kill some more orcs, #, and than we will talk.
What claim do you have to the friendship of the Sindar, #?
What deeds do you have to your name, #?
You are not yet thought of highly enough to fight with my Elves in battle, #.
Show us that you can be trusted, #, and we will fight alongside you.
You will have to prove yourself to our kin, if you wish to command the Sindar.
We Elves do not follow any stranger into battle. You must prove your worth first.
Prove your allegiance to us, and we shall ally with you.
You must prove yourself worthy first, if you wish to lead us to battle.
Only a true friend of our folk may lead us against the servants of Morgoth.
We Sindar are yet to hear of great deeds by you, #. Show your worth and we will follow you.
Do not ask for the fellowship of the Sindar, #. We do not readily ally with strangers.
