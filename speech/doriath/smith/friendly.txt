What can I do for you, #?
It is good to see a friend of the Sindar.
I'm still looking for an apprentice.
The Girdle keeps us safe, #. It is dangerous to go beyond it.
We want no part in the affairs of the Noldor.
Have you gazed upon the halls of Thingol? Get ye to Menegroth, and wonder.
Foul things move abroad. Let us trust in the Girdle of Melian to keep Morgoth back.
It is a dangerous world, #. Wear some armour to keep yourself safe.
A few silver coins will earn you keen swords and stout breastplates.
My blades are sharp and my armour stout.
If you search for arms and armour, #, you have found what you need.
For many a year have I forged iron.
For a small price, you can buy fine arms and armour.
If you venture beyond the Girdle, #, take these with you.
Keep yourself safe, #.
