Get ye gone from this place!
Return to your master Morgoth!
We do not want your kind here, #!
Already our soldiers hunt your trail, #!
What are you doing this side of the Girdle?
Our blades will cut you down.
Do you fear death, #?
Begone, #, and do not return.
We do not want your sort here.
There is no place for foul things like you in this forest.
I do not deal with the likes of you!
There is nothing here for you, #. Begone!
Tell me, how does it feel to die in Doriath?
What devilry brought you through the Girdle?
You will not leave here alive.
