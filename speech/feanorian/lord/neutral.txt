We have made alliances with men in the past. So far, only one has proved faithful...
The Sons of Fëanor are not foolish enough to trust any man that promises aid!
If you truly desire to help us, then you must first prove your loyatly!
Can you promise the safe return of the Silmarils, #?
If you prove to be as faithless as the traitorous Ulfang, your death will soon arrive...
You desire the aid of the Fëanorians? Prove your worth, and perhaps, I shall consider it.
Any warrior can slay a filthy goblin of Morgoth. Do not think you are special!
I cannot trust you, #. Begone from our lands before my warriors put you down...
Do you truly wish to lead my forces?
Soon, we shall assail the Gates of Angband. Soon, the Silmaril will be returned to our hands...
