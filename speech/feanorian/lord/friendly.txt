Will you lead our forces to the Gates of Angband?
The Sons of Fëanor are eager to achieve our revenge. Will you be the one to lead us?
My warriors have ravaged the plains of Lothlann. Yet, even this, has not satisfied them...
The only thing that we desire is the head of Morgoth and our rightful treasure.
If you seek aid in defeating the Dark Lord, the Sons of Fëanor will assist you in your quest!
Promise the safe return of the Silmarils, and we will glady lay down our lives for you!
Soon, we shall march upon the Gates of Angband, and reclaim what is ours!
Will you face the Enemy with us, #?
We swore an oath of vengeance, #. We intend to keep it.
Soon, we shall march against the forces of the Enemy.
We do not easily forget treachery, #.
