Begone from here, #!
You are not welcome here...
I cannot trust one who has not proven their loyatly to the Sons of FÃ«anor.
My horses only trust who desire to reclaim the Silmarils!
I shall not allow one I do not know to enter my stables!
Prove your worth to our righteous cause and I will consider selling you one of my horses!
