Only a Son of Fëanor may hold the Silmarils!
Morgoth may have defiled Fëanor's greatest works, but the Silmarils belong to us!
Give up the Silmarils or give up your life!
Foul scum, you dare steal our greatest treasure?
The Silmarils have been stolen before. I shall not let them be taken again!
Only a rightful heir of Fëanor may possess the Silmaril!
I shall burn you at the stake, #!
So you have chosen death, #.
Release the Silmaril from your theiving hands and I will consider letting you live...
We followed Fëanor from Valinor to recover his treasure. There is nothing that can stop our pursuit!
Perish like the Teleri who refused to aid our cause!
I shall slice your wretched head clean off!
The Silmarils belong to us!
Surely, you are a filth of Angband!
You were foolish to deny us our rightful treasure!
Your greed will be the end of you, #!
