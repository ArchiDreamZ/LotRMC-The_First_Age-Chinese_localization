You dare to show your face in these lands, #?
I will not allow you to defile these lands!
You take us too lightly, #!
I will strike you down!
Vengeance will be mine, #!
We will take that which is ours!
You are not welcome here, wretched servant of the Enemy!
You will be dealt death before the day is done!
Begone from this land, foul creature, your presence will not be tolerated!
Your doom has come, #!
I will see you fall before me, #!
Fear the might of the Noldor, #!
For the Sons of Feanor!
No servant of the Enemy will survive my wrath!
My vengeance will be swift and merciless, #!
I will see you fall before me!
Your doom has come!
Vengeance will be mine!
I will strike you down, #!
I shall have my revenge!
No spawn of Morgoth will survive my wrath!
Your evil shall not be tolerated within these lands, #!
You are bold indeed to show your face here!
You are bold indeed to show your face here, #!
The Sons of FÃ«anor will not allow you to leave this land alive, #!
Your evil has no place here, #!
You will regret ever coming here!
You will not live to see another day!
You will not live to see another day, #!
