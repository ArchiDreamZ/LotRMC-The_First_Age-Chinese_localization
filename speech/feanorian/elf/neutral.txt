State your purpose, #.
We have trusted your kind before...
Only the House of Bór have remained faithful...
Are you a pawn of Morgoth?
A friend of Thingol, is no friend of ours...
Pray that you are not of the kin of Ulfang.
What brings you to our lands, #?
Where do you hail from, #?
Are you a spy of our enemies?
I give you a warning, #. Do not linger here much longer. You are not trusted...
If you dare stand in the way of our oath, you will be severely punished.
The Valar banished us from Valinor, they are no better than the Enemy.
The Elves of Thingol refuse to aid us in our struggle against the Enemy, they are no friends of mine!
Soon, we shall march upon the Gates of Angband, and reclaim what is ours!
We do not easily forget treachery, #.
Be they foe or friend, any who deny us of a Silmaril will face the wrath of the Sons of Fëanor!
Morgoth's treachery shall not be forgotten!
If you intend to stand in the way of our oath, I will ensure you do not take another breath...
We swore an oath of vengeance, #. We intend to keep it.
Soon, we shall march against the forces of the Enemy.
The Valar abandoned us long ago, #.
The Valar are not our allies, #.
Nothing will stop us from recovering what is rightfully ours!
The Teleri refused to aid our righteous cause, and they paid for that treachery.
We faced the Enemy under the stars, and pursued his wretched armies back to their foul pits.
I will pry the Silmarils from Morgoth's crown myself!
These are the lands of the Sons of Fëanor, #.
The men of the House of Bór swore allegiance to Maedhros. Let us hope they keep their word.
I suggest you depart from our lands before it is too late...
