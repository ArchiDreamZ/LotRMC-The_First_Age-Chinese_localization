You have proved your loyalty to the Sons of Fëanor, #. I will be honoured to fight by your side.
Morgoth shall soon know the wrath of Fëanor!
Let us reclaim our rightful treasure!
Be they foe or friend, any who deny us of a Silmaril will face the wrath of the Sons of Fëanor!
Morgoth's treachery shall not be forgotten!
The Sons of Fëanor will lead us to victory.
Soon, we shall march upon the Gates of Angband, and reclaim what is ours!
Nothing will stop us from recovering what is rightfully ours!
I see your blade is stained with the blood of our foes, #!
The taint of Morgoth's filth will soon be ridden from Arda!
