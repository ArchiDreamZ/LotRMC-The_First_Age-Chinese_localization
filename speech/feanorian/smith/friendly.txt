The kin of Fëanor are the greatest in all of Arda. The beauty of Fëanor's works even enthralled the Dark Lord!
Aye, so you desire to reclaim our lost treasure? I would be honoured to forge a mighty weapon for you!
With your help, the Silmarils shall soon be ours!
My work may not compare to the beauty of Fëanor's works, however, their quality far surpasses the work of anyone in Beleriand!
My weapons are ready for the battle against Morgoth!
Maedhros has requested enough weapons to supply an army! Soon, we shall march upon the ashen plains of Anfauglith! 
I suggest you purchase my weapons before they are gone!
