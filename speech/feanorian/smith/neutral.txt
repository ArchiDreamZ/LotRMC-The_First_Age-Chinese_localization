My weapons are not for any man to buy...
Only those who pledge their allegiance to the Sons of FÃ«anor may have the honour of wielding my blades!
Prove your loyalty and I will gladly forge you a mighty sword!
The forces of Himring have need of my weapons. There are no more for you, #!
Do you think I am foolish enough to sell my wares to one who may strike me down?
How do I know you are not scum of Morgoth?
Begone from here, #! I shall not sell anything to you!
