The Valar banished us from Valinor, they are no better than the Enemy.
The Elves of Thingol refuse to aid us in our struggle against the Enemy, they are no friends of mine!
Soon, we shall march upon the Gates of Angband, and reclaim what is ours!
We do not easily forget treachery, #.
Be they foe or friend, any who deny us of a Silmaril will face the wrath of the Sons of Fëanor!
Morgoth's treachery shall not be forgotten!
Under the command of Maedhros, we shall reclaim what is ours!
Will you face the Enemy with us, #?
We swore an oath of vengeance, #. We intend to keep it.
Soon, we shall march against the forces of the Enemy.
The Valar abandoned us long ago, #.
The Valar are not our allies, #.
Nothing will stop us from recovering what is rightfully ours!
The Teleri refused to aid our righteous cause, and they paid for that treachery.
Do not believe the lies of other Elven kingdoms, only the Sons of Fëanor have claim to the Silmarils.
If any stand in the way of our quest, we will not hestitate to raze their homes to the ground...
No man, woman, or child, will deter us from our oath.
We faced the Enemy under the stars, and pursued his wretched armies back to their foul pits.
I will pry the Silmarils from Morgoth's crown myself!
The men of the House of Bór swore allegiance to Maedhros. Let us hope they keep their word.
Darkness brews in the north, #. Be wary when you travel.
The forces of the Enemy grow bolder by the day, and attack closer to our borders.
Do not fear the eyes of the Dark Lord, #.
We shall tear the Iron Crown from Morgoth's skull! Let him be punished for all of his crimes!
We are those who followed Fëanor under the stars, #.
The wrath of Fëanor was so great, his body burned to ash when he succumbed to his wounds.
Have you sworn an oath, #?
I see your blade is stained with the blood of our foes, #!
What brings you to our lands, #?
Where do you hail from, #?
We will not forgive nor forget the treachery of Morgoth, #!
