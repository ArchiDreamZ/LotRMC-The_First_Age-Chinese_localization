State your purpose, #.
We have trusted your kind before...
Only the House of Bór have remained faithful...
Are you a pawn of Morgoth?
A friend of Thingol, is no friend of ours...
Pray that you are not of the kin of Ulfang.
What brings you to our lands, #?
Where do you hail from, #?
Are you a spy of our enemies?
I give you a warning, #. Do not linger here much longer. You are not trusted...
If you dare stand in the way of our oath, you will be severely punished.
We do not easily forget treachery, #.
Be they foe or friend, any who deny us of a Silmaril will face the wrath of the Sons of Fëanor!
If you intend to stand in the way of our oath, I will ensure you do not take another breath...
We swore an oath of vengeance, #. We intend to keep it.
Nothing will stop us from recovering what is rightfully ours!
The Teleri refused to aid our righteous cause, and they paid for that treachery.
We faced the Enemy under the stars, and pursued his wretched armies back to their foul pits.
For your sake, let us hope you are no enemy to the Sons of Fëanor...
