Why have you come to Lord Sauron's lands, worm?
My master is greatest among all of the Dark Lord's servants.
Our master rewards service, #. Do not dare oppose us.
Do not align yourself with the scum of Valinor, #.
I have no time for the likes of you. Begone.
I know you not. Do we share a master?
Linger here, and my orcs will tear the flesh from your bones.
Flee these lands, while Lord Sauron still allows it.
I have not been bid to kill you, #. But that does not mean you are welcome here.
With the power of my master's wolves, all of Middle-Earth shall be cast into the shadow.
The might of Tol-in-Gaurhoth marches to war, and soon, all the world shall tremble.
It is said that in the east, the lands of the elven filth are burning.
Be you a spy of the accursed elves, walking among us?
Our blades bring dark spells upon our enemies. Pray you do not feel their sting, #.
The men of the House of Ulfang have chosen the winning side. Are you their envoy, puny Man?
