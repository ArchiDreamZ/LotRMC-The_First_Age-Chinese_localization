My orcs shall devour your bones!
You will not leave my master's lands alive, #!
Lord Sauron bids your doom, worm. Die quickly.
Even I am not so high and mighty as to deprive myself of the meal of your flesh!
Perish, Valarin scum!
Even the wolves are not so bold as you, little man.
Run back to the realms of men, #! They too shall fall under the Shadow!
Lord Sauron shall reward me when I bring him your head!
Taste the sting of my blade, worm of the west!
It is a shame you will not live to watch your world fall, #!
You are fool to oppose the might of the Lord of Tol-in-Gaurhoth!
The wolves of Tol-in-Gaurhoth will dine well on your eyes, #!
For Lord Sauron! For the Shadow!
Flee back into the light, coward of Valinor!
Our numbers shall darken the skies! Middle-Earth will die, and you with it!
