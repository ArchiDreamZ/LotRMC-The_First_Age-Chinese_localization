Our conquest looms, #. Will you march beside our armies?
Join me, #. We shall lay waste to the world, and bring death to men and elves!
What word do you bring from beneath the spires of Thangorodrim?
None may stand the might of the wolves of Tol-in-Gaurhoth.
From the forests to the plains, Beleriand will burn!
Soon, we march forth, and my orcs will have all the man-flesh they could ever eat.
Lord Sauron has spoken of you, #. We are at your service.
I see we serve the same master, #.
The enemies of Lord Sauron will wither at the touch of my blade!
The time of our victory is at hand.
May the rivers be choked with bodies, and run red with the blood of Morgoth's foes!
The wraiths of Tol-in-Gaurhoth shall bring a deathly chill to the lands of men.
Lord Sauron has promised us flesh and treasure, #. Will you share in our spoils?
The northern trolls are strong, but the wolves of Sauron are stronger.
Do you have word from our master, #?
