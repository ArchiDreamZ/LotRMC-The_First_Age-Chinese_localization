What do silver coins and Man-flesh have in common? I never have enough of them!
You want some mercenaries, #? I want some coins.
Get your fighting Orcs here! Starting at just a few silver coins!
I want to get my stinking hands on some more silver coins!
The forces of Tol-in-Gaurhoth are ready for hire, maggot!
Tol-in-Gaurhoth has many fine stinking Orcs for you to command!
The filth of Tol-in-Gaurhoth doesn't come cheap, #!
You want to hire some maggots from Tol-in-Gaurhoth? Just bring me some stinking coins!
You want my boys, you can have them! For a dozen silver coins of course. Ha! Ha!
My boys are the finest Orcs in all of Tol-in-Gaurhoth! They'll serve you well - for the right price...
Orcs aren't free. You'll need to give me some coins, or no deal!
