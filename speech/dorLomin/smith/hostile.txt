We have no room for the likes of you in Dor-l√≥min!
We've dealt with outlaws like you before, #!
I knew the Dark Lord is sending his forces to attack us!
How did you slip past the gatekeeper?!
Call for the guards, we're under attack!
Don't come bringing trouble to our peaceful village, why you.
What is the matter with you, acting like that!
There is no room for ill-folk such as yourself in the Land of Echoes!
Don't underestimate this craftsman's strength, #!
You fool, I can bend iron. Your bones will be no match!
You think I haven't had the Orcs try these things on me before?
A horse shows more resistance than you!
You will regret coming back here, we know what you did!
