Men of the House of Hador, I've got wares for all!
Outsider, you would not want to miss the opportunity to look at Dor-l√≥min's finest, would you?
Best wares of the House of Hador, right here!
I'm in the mood for a good trade, how about you?
The best the Men of the North can produce, all for a sharp low price!
Best ironworks this side of Hithlum, what can I do for you?
Horseshoes, bits and bridles, gardening tools, I can work iron into something you can work with!
A pound of iron, a piece of silver, as long as I can work with it!
Weapons are not my speciality, but I can help you with the essentials.
Forging is what I've done all my life, and I plan to teach my children the same.
Your requests are far more reasonable than the requests I get from the Elves.
I may not know how to work the steel of Elves, but iron! Iron I can work with!
Hammer, shape me a sturdy sword!
My weapons are strong, no matter they are not made by the Elves.
