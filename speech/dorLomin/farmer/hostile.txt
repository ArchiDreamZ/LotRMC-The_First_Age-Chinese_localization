We have no room for the likes of you in Dor-l√≥min!
Flee to the North, to the rest of your kind!
We've dealt with outlaws like you before, #!
Begone, before we send the hounds after you!
How did you slip past the gatekeeper?!
Call for the guards, we're under attack!
Don't come bringing trouble to our peaceful village, why you.
Did somebody do your head in?
What is the matter with you, acting like that!
There is no room for ill-folk such as yourself in the Land of Echoes!
Off my lands, fiend!
You must be the thief, taking off with our crops at night. Well that's about to end!
Hands off the plant, accursed one!
Taking you down ain't much, but it's honest work!
Hey! You there back there! You know I will catch up with you! I've seen your face!
