Greetings, #!
You're not one of the servants of the Enemy, are you?
It's been raining a lot lately, have you noticed?
If you are in need of a supply of wheat, you came to the right land!
Dor-lómin is all right, but I prefer Estolad myself.
Every time the Elves come by, our coffers are filled with gold.
It has been raining an awful lot here lately...
Rain, rain, rain. Nothing but rain here in Dor-lómin. What I would not do for some sun, instead.
They say when it rains the best tales are told over a glass of wine.
Dor-lómin has been our home since our ancestors came here to help and serve the House of Fingolfin.
I like having the Elves around, they make me feel safe and protected.
Dor-lómin has long survived on the patronage of the Eldar.
I'm worried the rain will ruin the upcoming harvest.
You'll only get the freshest of crops with me.
Looking to buy some extra hands to tend to your lands?
Are you looking for extra hands, or for what the harvest has brought in?
The Men of Dor-lómin are hard workers, I guarantee it!
After the War few years ago, we no longer let strangers roam here freely.
The finest hard-working hands of the House of Hador, at your service!
These lands are cold and rainy, but quite fertile!
