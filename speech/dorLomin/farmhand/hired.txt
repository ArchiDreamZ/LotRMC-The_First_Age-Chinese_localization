What's my task today? Watering, planting, or harvesting?
Show me where you want me to plant these crops, #.
These seem like some fine lands to work.
When do we start? Also, when is our break?
You want me to work here, or somewhere else?
Hand me the seeds, I'll bring you the crop.
Is there a chest for me to put the harvest in?
Ready to work, #!
This is fine weather for honest work, don't you agree?
One day, I will be the one with my own farm, lending out farmhands of my own.
People keep complaining about the Orcs, but it's the rabbits that grind my gear.
Why has there never been a farming tool known as a bird-bane?
I find new rabbit holes trying to destroy my crops every night.
