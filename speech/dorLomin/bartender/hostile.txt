You may go no further. You will not enter Dor-Lomin!
Sons of Dor-Lomin! Hold your ground!
You may not enter the Land of Echoes, #!
For Dor-lómin!
You are an enemy of the Men of the North, #!
Enemies have entered Dor-lómin!
Cursed be, servant of the Enemy! I will see you slain!
I swear that your death shall be swift!
Your death shall be swift, #!
This is a fell hour for the House of Hador indeed!
Aurë entuluva!
You will not see the end of this day, servant of the Shadow!
Begone from our lands, foul spawn of Angband!
I will not allow you to harm the people of Dor-lómin, #!
In the name of the Lords of West, I shall destroy you!
No enemies of the House of Hador may pass freely into our land!
