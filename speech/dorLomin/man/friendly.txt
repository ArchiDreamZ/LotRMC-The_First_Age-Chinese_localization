Welcome to Dor-lómin, #!
Good day, #.
Welcome, my lord #. Is there anything I can do for you?
The House of Hador welcomes you, #.
These are dark times for Dor-lómin, #.
Men whisper of fell creatures spawning in the North, and tell tales of a nameless fear...
Welcome, #. Would that you had come to Dor-lómin in happier days.
Do not be afraid, my friend #. The Elves of Hithlum will come to our aid if we are attacked. They always come to our aid.
These are troubled times for our people. Darkness gathers in the North, and our allies are falling one by one.
This country is my home, #. I fear for us all in these dark days.
I wish that I could welcome you to Dor-lómin in happier times.
My friends have heard whispers of another invasion from the Dark Lord.
You're not from around these parts, are you, #?
I'd rather be down at the tavern right now.
There's some troubling news going around. I can tell you that much.
I should warn you, #. With the passing of Fingolfin, the realm of Hithlum is not as strong as it once was.
They say the shadow of Morgoth is growing in the North.
How do you fare?
Do you have anything to drink?
You don't look much like a Man of Hador, #. You're not from the East, are you?
Which village do you come from, #?
There is little quite so beautiful as the sight of the Sun's first rays cast upon the mountain-peaks.
When I was younger, I dreamed of pledging my service to the High King. Those times seem far away now.
We do what we can to survive, #. But if the Enemy comes, we will not be able to do much.
Good day, #! But do I mean to say that the day is good, or that it is a day to be good on?
I hope that my family shall not be conscripted into the levies of Dor-lómin.
With the presence of Orcs in the Pass of Sirion, I cannot help but worry for my kin.
The heroes of Dor-lómin shall rise to protect us, #.
Welcome, #. What business brings you to Dor-lómin?
