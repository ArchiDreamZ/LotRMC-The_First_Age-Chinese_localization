I fight for Dor-lómin, #.
May our deeds restore Beleriand to its former glory!
The foes of Dor-lómin shall fall before us!
For the House of Hador!
Our enemies are right to fear the might of Dor-lómin, #!
You are a true friend of Dor-lómin, #.
Aurë entuluva!
We shall follow you through death and ruin!
We are proud to fight amongst a great warrior such as you!
For the House of Hador! For Dor-lómin!
The scum of Angband shall face our wrath!
Ruin to all the enemies of Dor-lómin and Hithlum!
