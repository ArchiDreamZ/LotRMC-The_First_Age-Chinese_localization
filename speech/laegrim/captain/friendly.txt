#, have you need of soldiers to slay the foul orcs? My warriors shall follow you into battle.
I shall grant you command of my finest warriors, for a small fee, of course.
The Elves of Ossiriand will follow any who oppose the Dark Lord.
Long have the Laegrim desired peace. However, if the Great Enemy will not allow us, then we have no choice to defend our forest.
#, if you protect our kind, we will fight by your side.
The warriors under my command are the greatest in all of Ossiriand!
#, you are a true friend of the Laegrim, I permit you to lead my warriors.
I have the best warriors in the lands of Ossiriand!
#, even my tireless soldiers require payment.
You have proved that you are a true friend of our people. I will allow you to hire my brave warriors.
In this dark age, we have no choice but to do nothing but defend. However, some of my warriors are willing to go on the offensive.
Do you have what it takes to lead the strongest elves of Ossiriand?
