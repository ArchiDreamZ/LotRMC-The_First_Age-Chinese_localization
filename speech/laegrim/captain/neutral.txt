#，the Laegrim have no desire to fight under a weak man like you.
Not a single Green-elf would be willing to follow your command.
#，only our allies may lead the warriors of Ossiriands.
You wish the emply my warriors? Prove your loyalty and I may consider it.
Begone, #. You are no ally of the Laegrim.
What kind of foolishness makes you think that the Green-elves would follow the leadership of a man.
We have seen the treachery of men before. Do not think we are foolish enough to trust you as well.
No man shall ever lead our armies. You are no exception.
#, you are not worthy enough to lead my kin.
If you prove your loyalty, I will consider letting you to hire my warriors.
My warriors will follow only a true friend of the Laegrim.
You are not ready to command the Elves of Ossiriand.
