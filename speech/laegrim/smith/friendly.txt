Welcome, #. What can I forge for you?
Our craft is second only to Gondolin's!
I have a variety of weapons for you!
No Orc-arrow can pierce my armor!
Mellon-nin. What can I do for you, #?
No foul creature can resist the wrath of my blades!
#，are there any weapons you require?
The forces of evil are growing stronger everyday. It is the duty of smiths, like me, to ensure our armies are strong enough to protect our forest.
A wicked blade of Angband can never compare to my blades!
An era of darkness is upon us... We must do our best to resist it.
Any enemy of the Laegrim will tremble in fear upon seeing the power of my swords!
My long life has rewarded me with the greatest skills in all of Arda.
