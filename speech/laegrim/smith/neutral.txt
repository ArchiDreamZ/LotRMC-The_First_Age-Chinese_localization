Why should I sell my weapons to one who I do not trust?
If you desire to purchase my blades, you must first prove your loyatly to the Laegrim.
Only a friend of Ossiriand may wield our weapons.
You are not worthy to wield my swords.
In this dark age, I cannot trust any man that I see.
I know of the treachery of men. Do not take me for a fool!
War is returning to Beleriand. I cannot afford to give my wares to any traveler that I meet.
How do I know you shall not strike me down with my own weapons?
Prove your loyatly and I will consider selling you my greatest works.
