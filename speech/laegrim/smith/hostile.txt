Begone from here, servant of Morgoth!
You will get nothing from me, orc-scum!
How dare you enter our forest, #!
I have nothing for you, #!
You are powerless here, servant of evil!
I would rather perish than let you take my weapons!
The only thing left you is your death!
Leave or bear the wrath of Ossiriand!
I will not allow you to desecrate my armor with your taint!
Return to the darkness from whence you came!
Leave our forest or face our wrath!
I will not allow to corrupt our land! Begone, #!
