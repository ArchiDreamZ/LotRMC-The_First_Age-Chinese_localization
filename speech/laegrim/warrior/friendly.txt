Under my watch, I shall ensure the forest is forever safe.
Careful, #. The darkness of Morgoth draws closer to our borders everyday.
Welcome to the land of Ossiriand!
I suggest that you be on your guard. Ever since the Battle of Sudden Flame, evil roams as far south as the hills of Andram.
We, Green-elves, don't need to be vigilant like the northern kingdoms. However, that does not mean we shall do nothing.
Before the arrival of the Dark Lord, the lands of Beleriand were at peace.
#, the arrows of the Laegrim are quicker than any other.
We are the Green-elves of Ossiriand.
No matter what the future may be, the value of great achievements will never diminish.
Our last king, Denethor, died bravely in the first battles of Beleriand. Even now, we refuse to name another king in his honour.
As the saying goes: in desperate circumstances, there is often hope to be born.
The forces of Morgoth will pay the price for Denethor's death.
Orcs will pay their price, and we will avenge Denethor.
The Laegrim has forseen the end of our age long ago... The other elven kingdoms refuse to acknowledge it.
The shadow of Angband grows longer and more powerful. I cannot help but fear the future...
The Orcs of Morgoth underestimated us due to the quality of our arms, and they paid dearly.
For a long time, the forests of Ossiriand have protected us from the threat of the Dark Lord.
Some of our kin have ventured to Doriath in hopes of protection for the forces of evil.
Long has King Thingol been a friend to our kin.
You humans are less than a year old for us elves, but you are still impressive.
Men may die, but your race is tough and daunting...
The Dwarves claim to be allies, yet I still cannot trust them.
