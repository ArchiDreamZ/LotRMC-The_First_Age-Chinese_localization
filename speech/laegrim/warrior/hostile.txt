Begone, foul creature of Morgoth!
Return to the darkness from whence you came!
You are not welcome here, #!
You are no friend of the Laegrim...
You shall bother the lands of Beleriand no longer!
I shall remove your evil from this land!
Ha! You are no faster than our bow and arrow!
Return to Udûn!
May your death bring peace to this land!
Let your death mark the end of your master's taint.
I will not allow you to corrupt our forest!
Prepare to meet your end, #!
Orc scum, do not think I won't kill you!
