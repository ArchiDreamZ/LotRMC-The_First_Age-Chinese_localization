For the lands of Ossiriand!
You might be strong, #. However, you cannot compare to the Laegrim.
Coins are meaningless. I follow you of my own accord, #.
Our enemies will fall and be trampled like the leaves of the forest!
Neither Orc nor evil humans can resist the strength of Ossiriand!
Let us dedicate our battle to the late Denethor.
My arrows are swift and my blades are sharp as I search for the flesh of the enemy.
#，my bow will sing with your blade! The bones of our enemies will shatter by our might.
Let us cleanse Beleriand of Morgoth's filth.
The day becomes dark and cold, but the light of reason has not disappeared from these lands!
The evil of Morgoth has returned to Beleriand. We shall not let us threaten us any further!
I will follow you through shadow and flame! No evil can bear our might!
In the name of all that is good, we shall cleanse Arda of evil!
No foul creature shall enter any land under our watch!
Fire!
One shot, one kill.
Standing guard!
My wait is over.
Ahh, the great forest!
Are we being invaded?
What is nature's call?
Fall like the leaves, in fall.
Taste my arrow!
Where shall I strike?
I am prepared. 
What is thy bidding?
