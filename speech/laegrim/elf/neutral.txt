Are you a friend of the Laegrim?
Tell me, #. Do you come in peace?
What tidings do you bring from the lands of Beleriand?
I would watch out if I were you. Outsiders are not trusted in our lands.
I shall keep my eye on you, #.
It is unwise to roam our land without notice.
Your presence makes me uneasy.
I do not trust your intentions. I would advise you to leave this land while you are still breathing...
From where do you hail, #?
I demand knowledge of your intentions. You are not trusted here.
The FÃ«anorians were fools to trust the men of Ulfang. We shall not make the same mistake...
For what reason have you come here, #?
Are you an ally of the Dark Lord?
