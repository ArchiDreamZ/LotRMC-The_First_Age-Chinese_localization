I do not trade with any old stranger that passes by...
You will have to prove your allegiance to our kin if you wish to make use of our food stores, #.
Your presence is still young in my mind. You have not yet proven yourself to our kin.
Only a true Elf-friend may enjoy our delicacies!
The days are growing ever darker in the world around us, but in this fair realm we shall endure.
You are not yet worthy enough to be entrusted with our food and drink.
No evil shall dare enter Tumladen under the watch and protection of my kin.
War is brooding. I can feel it in the air. Soon, the Evil shall come to our lands.
You must prove yourself to our kin if you wish to trade with me.
These are dark times, #. I cannot simply trust any stranger that comes upon our valley.
