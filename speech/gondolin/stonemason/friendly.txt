Greetings, #. What can I forge for you?
The smith-skill of my kin is amongst the greatest in these lands!
Elven brick is the strongest in Arda.
Our walls are impenetrable!
What do you need, mellon-nin?
No spawn of evil may stand against walls!
What can I get you, #? 
These are dark times, #. We must defend our borders. It is my duty to provide my liege with materials.
These times are dangerous. Many Orcs have been sighted near our lands... they must be driven away or else the Shadow shall win.
I am always in need of more stone for my craft-work. I will reward you if you bring me some.
