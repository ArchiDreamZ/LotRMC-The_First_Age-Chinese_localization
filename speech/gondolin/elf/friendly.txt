The world is indeed full of peril.
What tidings do you bring to the land of Gondolin?
What tidings do you bring, #?
Gilthoniel! O Elbereth!
Miruvor! Refreshes the body and cleanses the spirit.
It is easy to lose oneself among our folk.
Are you an Elf-friend, #?
No evil shall enter the realm of Gondolin.
In this land, the memory of Aman lingers still.
You cannot call yourself a true Elf-friend until you have tasted lembas, #.
A darkness is gathering outside these lands. I feel it in my flesh.
The strength of the Elves is strong here.
I have seen years of the sun beyond the count of mortal Men.
Welcome to the house of King Turgon, #.
May the stars of Elbereth guide you!
May the winds of Manwë show you the way!
A star shines upon the hour of our meeting, #.
May the leaves of your life tree never turn brown, #!
Ai, #!
Don't look for trouble, # - it will come to you.
Welcome to my dwelling, #.
Nover.
That what should be shall be.
Our love for this land is deeper than the depths of the Sea.
We would rather cast all that we love away than submit to the will of the Dark Lord.
A star rises out of the darkness.
Greetings, traveller from afar! What news do you bring to us from the lands of Men and Elves?
One has not truly felt pain until they have crossed the frigid ices of the Helcaraxë.
