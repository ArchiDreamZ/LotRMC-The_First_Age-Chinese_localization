No evil may set foot in Tumladen!
You may not enter Gondolin!
#, you may not set foot in Gondolin!
You breathe so loudly I could have shot you in the dark.
You are unwelcome in our lands.
Your presence is unwelcome here.
You are no Elf-friend, #!
The Enemy has no hold over Tumladen!
You may not bring evil here, #!
Your darkness shall not poison our Houses!
To Ud√ªn with you!
Go and kiss an Orc!
Death to the foes of the Elves!
Who brings to us this token of doom?
Begone, servant of evil!
Go back to the shadow whence you came!
We shall not allow evil to enter our realm. Leave now or face our wrath!
You bring great evil here, #. You can go no further.
How dare you poison this fair realm with your foul feet?
