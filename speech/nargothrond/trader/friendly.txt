Greetings from the land of Nargothrond, #!
The treasures of Nargothrond may be bought for silver coins.
If you desire Elven crafts, I could exchange something for silver coins.
Do you wish to trade, #?
The darkness of Morgoth grows stronger, but I value silver coins as much as the next merchant.
Greetings, #. Perhaps you have something to trade?
I am a Noldor Elf of the folk of King Finrod.
I shall soon be leaving these lands.
I bring you the craftwork of the Elves of Nargothrond!
Mae govannen, #! Do you wish to trade with me?
I have travelled far and wide... and now I come to you! I have many treasures that will interest you, #.
I hail from Nargothrond, and I bring many gifts and treasures with me!
You have not seen beauty until you have beheld the valley of Nargothrond, #!
