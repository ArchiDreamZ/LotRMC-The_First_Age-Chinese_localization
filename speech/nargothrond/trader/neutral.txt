If you wish to trade, you must enact some more good in the world.
I only offer the crafts of the Elves to those we can trust.
If you seek to trade, #, I suggest you prove your worth.
Are you Elf-friend, #?
The threat of Morgoth calls me home.
I shall not tarry long in this land.
Prove your allegiance to the Elves of Nargothrond, and then I may trade with you.
I cannot be certain that the Enemy has no hold over you.
My mind tells me to trade with you, but my heart does not yet trust you, #.
You are not yet a friend of the Elves of Nargothrond.
Do more good in this world and then I shall trade with you.
I do not trust any stranger that I meet. You need to prove yourself to my kin first.
