No evil may set foot on our land!
You may not enter Nargothrond.
#, you may not set foot in Nargothrond!
You breathe so loudly I could have shot you with my eyes closed. 
You are unwelcome in our lands.
Your presence is unwelcome here.
You are no friend of Finrod, #!
The Enemy has no hold over Nargothrond!
You may not bring evil here, #!
Your darkness shall not poison the Fairest Realm!
To Ud√ªn with you!
Go and kiss an Orc!
Death to the foes of Finrod!
Who brings to us this token of doom?
Begone, servant of the Enemy!
Go back to the shadow whence you came!
We shall not allow evil to enter our realm. Leave now or face our wrath!
You bring great evil here, #. You can go no further.
How dare you poison this fair realm with your foul feet?
We out to use you as huting bait, #!
