What brings you to our great caverns, #?
We follow the great King Finrod! 
The hills of Taur-en-Faroth are well guarded by our scouts. 
Our patrols guard the plain of Tumhalad, will you join them, #?
We patrol the hills of Taur-en-Faroth and Talath Dirnen, no Evil escapes our arrows. 
Welcome to the city upon the three streams! 
No evil will ever dwell here. 
No evil escapes our knowledge. 
Our scouts reported your arrival, welcome, #!
Our hidden realm shall remain hidden with your help. 
Have you tried our wine, straight from our caverns!
We hunt the Enemy in darkness, our arrows strike from every direction.
The beauty of our city in unrivalled! 
The glistening caverns of Nargothrond will bring you joy! 
The Enemy likes to think we are his prey, but the hunter is being hunted! 
We are surely the fairest out of all the Elven Realms. 
Do you possess a hood and bow, #?
Not many have seen the majesty of our caverns, #. 
Our scouts are the all seeing eye, every bit of land is watched and guarded.
