We Elves are among the finest warriors in all Middle-earth.
You need our bows, and our spears, #.
Few can match our skill in stealth. 
We fight with hood and bow, #. 
We are the warriors of Finrod. 
Our arrows travel faster than you can say "Dago Hon!", #
Together we will purge any chance of evil invading our lands. 
Our legions are many, and we shall fight with you, #. 
Ambush is our way, the Enemy will not predict it.
