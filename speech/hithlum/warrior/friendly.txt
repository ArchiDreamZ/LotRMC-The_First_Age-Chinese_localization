The time of the Elves is growing, our strength grows.
I defend the Elves of Hithlum.
Greetings, #.
We defend all that is fair in in Mithrim.
It seems you are a friend of Fingolfin, #.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
How many Orcs have you slain today, #?
The world is changing, #... I feel it in my heart.
If you fight for freedom, then I am with you.
An alliance is shared amongst our people. Will you honour that alliance?
We will soon ready for battle against the Enemy.
Welcome, #, to the land of Fingolfin, the fair realms of Dor-l√≥min and Mithrim!
You shall find no evil in Hithlum, #! Our land is safe and fair.
I have protected these shores for many a year.
I protect the folk of this land. No evil shall escape my wrath.
