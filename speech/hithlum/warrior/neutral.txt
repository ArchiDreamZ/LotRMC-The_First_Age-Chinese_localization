You must prove yourself, #
Welcome to the realm of Fingolfin.
Our soldiers are watching you stranger, we are not merciful to evil! 
We seek to destroy the scum of Morgoth, where do your allegiances lye, #? 
You must prove yourself to Fingolfin to feel the warm embrace of our people! 
The Elves of this land are hospitable, prove your worth, #
Not all may set foot in this land, we will watch you stranger. 
I fear that you may carry the stench of evil, but I hope you are filled the the good of the Valar, #
