I have many fine warriors for hire, #.
Do you seek to command the forces of Fingolfin?
Have you any silver coins, #?
If you fight for a noble cause, then my forces will support you.
Even our Elven warriors require payment, #.
There are few in Middle-earth who can match the prowess of an Elf in battle.
You seek to form an alliance with the Elves? We would be honoured.
May the grace of the Valar watch over you in battle.
May your arrows fly far and your sword cut swiftly!
We are allies against evil, since Elf and Man have fought together.
If you truly fight for the good in this world, my Elves will follow you anywhere.
I grant you the finest warriors from the realms of Hithlum!
