No evil may set foot on our fair land!
You may not enter Hithlum.
#, you may not set foot in Hithlum!
You breathe so loudly I could have shot you in the dark.
You are unwelcome in our lands.
Your presence is unwelcome here.
You are no friend of Fingolfin, #!
The Enemy has no hold over Hithlum!
You may not bring evil here, #!
Your darkness shall not poison our fair realm!
To Ud√ªn with you!
Go and kiss an Orc!
Death to the foes of the Elves!
Who brings to us this token of doom?
Begone, servant of the Enemy!
Go back to the shadow whence you came!
We shall not allow evil to enter our realm. Leave now or face our wrath!
You bring great evil here, #. You can go no further.
How dare you poison this fair realm with your foul feet?
None shall pass our mighty fortress of Barad Eithel!
