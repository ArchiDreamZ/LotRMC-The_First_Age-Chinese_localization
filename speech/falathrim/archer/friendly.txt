The time of the Elves is growing, our strength grows.
I defend the Elves of the Falas.
Greetings, #.
We defend all that is fair in Falas.
It seems you are a friend of the Teleri, #.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
How many Orcs have you slain today, #?
The world is changing, #... I feel it in my heart.
If you fight for freedom, then I am with you.
An alliance is shared amongst our people. Will you honour that alliance?
We will soon ready for battle against the Enemy.
Welcome, #, to the land of CÃ­rdan the Shipwright!
You shall find no evil in the Falas, #! Our land is safe and fair.
I have protected these shores for many a year.
I protect the Teleri of the Havens. No evil shall escape my wrath.
