No evil may set foot on our shores!
You may not enter Falas.
#, you may not set foot in Falas!
You breathe so loudly I could have shot you in the dark.
You are unwelcome in our lands.
Your presence is unwelcome here.
You are no Teleri-friend, #!
The Enemy has no hold over Falas!
You may not bring evil here, #!
Your darkness shall not poison the Fair Realm by the Sea!
To Ud√ªn with you!
Go and kiss an Orc!
Death to the foes of the Elves!
Who brings to us this token of doom?
Begone, servant of the Enemy!
Go back to the shadow whence you came!
We shall not allow evil to enter our realm. Leave now or face our wrath!
You bring great evil here, #. You can go no further.
How dare you poison this fair realm with your foul feet?
