We Elves are among the finest warriors in all Middle-earth.
You need our warships, and our spears, #.
Few can match the prowess of an Elf in combat.
The Evil-scum shall perish by bow and blade!
You have our allegiance, #.
I seek to defend all that is good in this world.
For Falas!
May the grace of Ã–sse protect us in combat, #.
Silver means little to an Elf, #, for we fight for a common cause.
My bow shall sing with your sword, #!
The bones of our foes will gleam under the Sun, their bones break against our waves #.
I shall follow you through shadow and flame! None shall withstand the gleaming light of our swords!
Let us cleanse this world of the foul scum of Morgoth!
Our time has just begun, are warriors will swarm the enemy like waves crashing on the beach!
Morgoth will not prevail. 
In the name of all that is good, let us cleanse this world of evil!
We must not allow evil to spread!
