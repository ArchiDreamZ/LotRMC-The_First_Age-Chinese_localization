The Sindar do not know you, #.
Are you friend or foe?
Do you bring evil into the Falas, #?
What brings you to Falas, #?
Why would you expect me to trust someone like you?
Who are you, #?
What is your business in these lands?
I do not trust you yet, #.
You are yet to prove your worth, #.
Add some deeds to your name, #.
You have not earned our trust.
I am uneasy about you, #.
I trust you are a friend?
We do not know you well, #.
From where do you hail, #?
We are wary of strangers, #. Add some deeds to your name and you shall earn our trust.
You are yet unknown to us, #.
