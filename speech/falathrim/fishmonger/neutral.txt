I do not trade with any old stranger that passes by...
Your presence is still young in my mind. You have not yet proven yourself to our kin.
A Man has not entered this realm of the Falathrim in many a year. You will have to prove yourself to the Teleri if you wish to wield our goods.
The days are growing ever darker in the world around us, but in this fair realm we shall endure.
The Evil has returned.
You are not yet worthy enough to be entrusted with our materials.
No evil shall dare enter the most Fair Realm under the watch and protection of my kin.
War is brooding. I can feel it in the air. Soon, the Evil shall come to our lands.
You must prove yourself to our kin if you wish to trade with me.
These are dark times, #. I cannot simply trust any stranger that wanders into our realm.
