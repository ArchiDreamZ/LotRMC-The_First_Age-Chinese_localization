There are other lands for me to visit. I think I shall be leaving soon.
My time here is almost at an end.
I shall not stay in these lands much longer.
The time has almost come to move on.
I will not tarry here forever.
The wind is calling. I must away soon.
If you wish to trade with me, you should hurry. I will be leaving soon.
I will have to depart soon.
