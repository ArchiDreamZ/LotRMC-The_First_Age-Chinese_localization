There you are, maggot! I've got news for you! The Boss says there's been an enemy spy sneaking around and killing our boys. Goes by the name of $ - a nasty Westerman, by the sound of it. We can't have that, can we? So I want you to go stick a blade in that filthy enemy scum, and then we'll see about a reward.
