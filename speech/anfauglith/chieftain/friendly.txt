What do silver coins and Man-flesh have in common? I never have enough of them!
You want some mercenaries, #? I want some coins.
Get your fighting Orcs here! Starting at just a few silver coins!
I want to get my stinking hands on some more silver coins!
The forces of Anfauglith are ready for hire, maggot!
Anfauglith has many fine stinking Orcs for you to command!
The filth of Anfauglith doesn't come cheap, #!
You want to hire some maggots from Anfauglith? Just bring me some stinking coins!
You want my boys, you can have them! For a dozen silver coins of course. Ha! Ha!
My boys are the finest Orcs in all of Anfauglith! They'll serve you well - for the right price...
Orcs aren't free. You'll need to give me some coins, or no deal!
Come and get your warrior Orcs here!
