I can still feel his glare...
There is no hope... He will capture us again...
This is all I have!
I must return back to the mines...
Flesh! I want flesh! No... What am I saying...?
It's too much! Please... end my suffering...
No, no, no! Please! Stay away!
We are nothing compared to the might of the Enemy...
The Valar have forsaken us... There is no hope...
There is no escape! Morgoth will find us!
Please spare me some coins!
I should have never followed the others to this horrible land! I must leave!
His glare is ever upon us... you cannot escape it. You will die!
We must obey... we must serve...
The darkness shall consume you. You cannot escape it.
No light... nothing but screams and shadow...
I have worked night and day for this... Please 
There is no way out! None!
Man-flesh! Sweet and juicy Man-flesh! I can smell it! No... What have I become...?
There is no light that can defeat the Shadow.
