Please... I cannot spare to sell you anything...
He will hurt me more if I give you anything...
No! This is all I have!
I have worked all day for this... Have mercy!
I beg of you! No more!
He is always watching! There is no escape!
Run! He knows you are here!
Begone! I cannot talk to you any longer!
I cannot do this anymore! It hurts!
Please... No more...
There is no hope...
Soon you shall be consumed by the darkness...
This is all I have... Have mercy...
Flesh! I smell flesh!
