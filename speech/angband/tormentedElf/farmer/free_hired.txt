I'll get right to it, #.
Please, no more...
Don't whip me! I'll do it, I will do it!
I'll obey, if it means my life shall be less miserable...
These rabbits are a plague!
I swear, those missing crops were the birds' work!
I am grateful...
I could not be happier...
This is a good life...
Anything is better than the slaver's cage.
Must I do any more work, #?
Will more work result in more payment, #?
I don't know where you come from, but you seem different from everyone else.
Here? So be it.
By the law, I am not meant to talk with you, #.
Perhaps you can let me go? No? So be it.
I'm sorry you had to pay so much for such a useless slave as me...
I'll sleep outside, that's fine.
