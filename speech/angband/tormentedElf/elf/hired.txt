No! Please... don't hurt me anymore...
I must serve Him. I must obey Him. 
We must obey... we must serve...
Help us! Please help us! We cannot endure any more!
Do you come to torture us?
Please... I shall follow your commands... 
Let me rest...
How many more thousands of years must I languish in these depths?
No light... nothing but screams and shadow...
There is no way out! None!
There is no hope...
