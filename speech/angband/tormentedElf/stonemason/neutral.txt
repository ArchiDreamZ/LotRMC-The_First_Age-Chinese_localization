Come crawling back when you've proved your worth, weakling.
The stench of evil on you is not yet strong enough, #.
If you wish to trade, you must prove your worth among our forces!
I've seen more threatening rats than you!
You want to trade? Come back when you're further down the path of darkness, scum.
Go capture some Elves for the Shadow, maybe then we can talk.
If you want any resources, you'll have to work more evil first.
There's no way I'm trading with a maggot like you!
Do you think my masters just lets me hand out materials to anyone, maggot?
Come back when you've done some evil!
I don't sell my materials to any maggot that passes by!
Prove yourself to us if you wish to get your hands on some of my fine goods!
Don't show me your ugly face again until you've done your service in the name of the Shadow.
