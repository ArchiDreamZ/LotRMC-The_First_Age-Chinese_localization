Get back to work, scum! Angband's armies ain't going to feed themselves!
A filthy maggot like you trying to hire some slaves? Hahaha!
Only the foulest get to hire my slaves, #!
You want to hire my slaves? Is this a joke?
I'm not selling any slaves to the likes of you, maggot!
If you want to buy slaves from me, you'll have to do some more evil.
Are you a slave, or what?
Get back to work! Oh, you're not a slave? But you may as well be, scum!
You want to hire slaves from me? Bad joke, scum!
Get back to work!
Those crops won't grow themselves!
You want some slaves, maggot? Prove yourself to me first!
You're not getting any of my slaves, filth!
You won't be getting any slaves from me until you do some evil!
Come back when you're not a filthy worm any more!
In my eyes, you're just another slave!
