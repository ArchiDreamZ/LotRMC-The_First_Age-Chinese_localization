What are you doing here, you filthy little Man?
I shall cook you on a stick, you filthy worm!
Run back to your pitiful tribe, filth!
I shall squish you like an insect!
I shall enjoy tearing you up, you puny worm!
Come here, boys! I've found our dinner! Ha! Ha!
There's nowhere to run, little Man!
Well, what do we have here? Oh yes! Dinner!
Filthy worm, how dare you enter our lands?
I'll make a good roast out of you!
You shall burn in the fire of Angband!
I will squish you like an insect, scum!
I'll make quick work out of you, filth!
You won't see the next day, Man-scum!
Your puny weapon is no match for me!
Did the elves send you? Ha! One filthy worm more which won't return.
I smell your fear!
The darkness will consume you!
Bow before me, and maybe I'll spare your life! Hm, I probably won't! Ha!
Bow before the Dark Lord!
You will suffer!
