I shall assist you, #!
No puny Man-blade may stop us!
We will proudly fight for you! The world of the Valar shall burn!
No mere Elf may stand in our way.
My heart desires battle and my stomach Man-flesh! Ha! Ha!
We shall plunder the rich lands of the Beleriand! Will you lead us, #?
I heard there's some good treasure in the north.
Man-flesh! I can already smell it.
We shall proudly fight alongside a great warrior such as you!
My warriors shall follow you!
Death to the enemies of Morgoth! Their lands shall soon be ours.
We shall burn the World of the Valar!
Come, #! The Dark Lord commands us to go South.
Can you get us some Man-flesh?
The Dark Lord is ever watching, #. We must obey it.
Soon we must depart to the South. War is calling.
War! Man-flesh! Treasure! We want it all!
Our armies shall crush the puny Children of Il√∫vatar!
I will fight by your side, #! You have shown your loyalty!
The Dark Lord is readying for war. Soon it shall unleash its might upon those pitiful Elves. Soon!
No-one shall stand in our way!
The Elf-scum shall tremble before us!
We serve the Great Lord of Angband!
Let us squish those filthy Men!
Can you smell the fear in those puny Elves? I can!
