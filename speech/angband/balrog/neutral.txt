Welcome to our land, little maggot!
We Boldogs are far better warriors than those puny little snaga.
Raaarrrgh!
The Dark Lord is ever watching.
The Great Lord of Angband is calling us. We must obey.
Do you bring us messages from Him, #?
We shall crush the pitiful races of the Valar!
Morgoth has promised us death and destruction. Will you join us?
Soon we shall rule these lands from North to South, and no puny Elf will be able to oppose us! Ha! Ha!
Flesh! My warriors want flesh!
I hear that the Dark Lord speaks highly of you. You may stay in our lands.
You may be a filthy little Man, #, but our Master seems to like you.
I heard that there are great fortresses to sack in the South.
Prepare your weapons, #! Our forces shall go to war in the South soon!
Do you have some Man-flesh for me?
We are mighty warriors! No puny Man may stand in our way!
You seem to be useful, so we won't kill you... for now! Ha! Ha!
Man-flesh we want, and Man-flesh we shall have!
The Dark Lord is calling us. We shall soon head into the South.
We serve the Lord of Angband!
No mere Elf may stand in our way!
Welcome, stranger. What do you want?
Soon, very soon, we shall have dominion over all these lands. Morgoth has promised it!
