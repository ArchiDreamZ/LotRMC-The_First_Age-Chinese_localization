Raaarrrgh!
The Dark Lord is ever watching.
The Great Lord is calling us. We must obey.
Do you bring us messages from Him, #?
We shall crush the pitiful races of the Valar!
Morgoth has promised us death and destruction. Will you join us?
Soon we shall rule these lands from North to South, and no puny Elf will be able to oppose us! Ha! Ha!
You may be a filthy little Man, #, but our Master seems to like you.
I heard that there are great fortresses to sack in the South.
Prepare your weapons, #! Our forces shall go to war in the South soon!
We are mighty warriors! No puny Man may stand in our way!
The Dark Lord is calling us. We shall soon head into the South.
No mere Elf may stand in our way!
Soon, very soon, we shall have dominion over all these lands. Morgoth has promised it!
