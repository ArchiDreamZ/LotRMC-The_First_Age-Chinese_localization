None dare stand in the path of the Valaraukar.
What is this? A worm out of the depths? How came you here?
You cannot escape. You shall be consumed by the darkness.
Fool, there is no escape. You cannot run, and you cannot hide.
What filthy spawn of the surface world are you? Bow down to the will of Melkor or you shall feel our wrath!
I am an Ainu, born of the songs that sung the world into being! Your pitiful weapon cannot harm me!
Fool, you shall soon meet your demise. No living being can escape the darkness of Melkor the Corruptor.
I am your doom. I am your death!
Death cannot save you, scum. Even your wretched spirit shall serve me!
You think your weak mortal flesh can challenge me?
Your tiny blade cannot pierce me, fool!
Pitiful fool. You shall meet your end soon.
Your pitiful flesh will be consumed by the darkness. Not even your blackened bones will remain.
