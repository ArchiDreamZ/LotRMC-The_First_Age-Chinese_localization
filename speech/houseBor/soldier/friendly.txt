I guard these lands.
Nothing shall threaten our House under my watch.
Our enemies fear our spears and swords.
I will not allow any Orc or bandit to enter this land!
The days are growing dark, #. I fear soon we shall be at war.
I gladly protect these lands.
Our land has grown great, thanks to the courage of brave soldiers. Yes! Just like myself!
Welcome to our country, #!
We must remain vigilant.
I hear worrisome reports of skirmishes on our borders.
Rumours say that the orcs are amassing their hordes to raid our country. I must hope they are but rumours.
We will purge Lothlann of those traitorous Easterlings, the vile House of Ulfang!
