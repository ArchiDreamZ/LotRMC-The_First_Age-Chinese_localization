Be gone, foul evil-servant!
Our guards will make swift work of you!
You will find no gain in this land.
Run, #! Run before our arrows get you!
You will pay for your crimes!
Leave this land, #!
You will pay for that!
Our soldiers will make quick work of you!
Away with you, scum!
Keep away from these lands, bandit-filth!
