You are welcome here in our realm, #.
The markets hold some of the finest antiquities from all around. You will find no better bargain elsewhere, #!
The wealth of trading has brought us prosperity and misfortune in the past... let's hope those times are past us.
Not many who still live can say they remember the dragons. It has been years since we've seen one... Luckily
Have you ever tasted our pastries before, #? They are the finest in all the world!
House Bór merchants travel far and wide to bring us great luxuries.
What can I do for you, #? Everyone is welcomed here with open hands.
Greetings! Welcome!
Where do you come from?
Some of us still recall how Bór with his green arrow slew the accursed bog troll of Lennon. That was truly a day to remember.
These lands have become very lively in the days since the bog trolls were slain.
