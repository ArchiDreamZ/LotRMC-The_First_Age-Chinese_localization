I offer the mighty warriors of House Bór for hire!
You will find the mightiest House Bór soldiers here!
For only a small sum of money, you may command several powerful soldiers.
Greetings, #! Are you here to hire some of my men?
None can match the skill of my soldiers.
Money wins wars, not men! Ha ha!

My men are the mightiest warriors in this land!
Nothing shall stand in the way of my men!
Do you wish to hire my men, #?
