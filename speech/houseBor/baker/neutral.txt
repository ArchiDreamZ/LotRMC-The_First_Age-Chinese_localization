I do not sell my products to any stranger who passes by!
Your money alone can't pay for my products.
Who are you even?
Come back when you're not nothing.
Prove yourself here and then I may sell you something!
You must prove yourself in these lands first, #.
Go and slay one of those renegades; then we'll talk!
