By the might of the Valar, bow!
You are nothing compared to the Valar, #.
Do you not remember my name?
It is never too late to turn from the path of the Darkness.
Winds of uncertainty surround your decision to face me!
Death to Morgoth's creations!
Even for one so deep in folly as you, the Valar may yet show mercy.
Cast aside your vain ambition and return to the right path!
