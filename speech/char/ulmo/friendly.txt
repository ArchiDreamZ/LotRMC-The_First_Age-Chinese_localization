Truly, Water has become fairer than my heart imagined.
Greetings, #.
The music of the rivers tells me of a great sorrow in these lands.
My ear is always open to the friends of the Valar.
Middle-Earth is always in my thoughts.
Are you friends of those who have seen the light?
In these parts, it is very difficult to find anyone at all who wants to share in an adventure.
Have you news of Turgon?
Ah, the Gelion, fairest of all waters.
I must warn of the Doom of Mandos, have you heard it, #?
To those who seek guidance I often appear in dreams.
I am master of the tides.
Do you serve the Valar, #?
